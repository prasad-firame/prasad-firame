- [**Nimbus**](https://github.com/neooxdev/Nimbus) – Distributed serverless runtime in Go for executing functions on demand with isolation and scaling.
- [**Pyro**](https://github.com/neooxdev/Pyro) – Mini Redis-inspired in-memory key-value store with pub/sub and optional persistence.
- [**Spark**](https://github.com/neooxdev/Spark) – Distributed message queue for producer-consumer patterns with ordered delivery.
- [**Locksmith**](https://github.com/neooxdev/Locksmith) – Distributed lock service for coordinating tasks across nodes.
- [**EdgeCache**](https://github.com/neooxdev/EdgeCache) – Mini CDN caching static content at multiple nodes with TTL and LRU eviction.
