# hello there 👋, More [about me](https://prasad-firame.github.io)

Here are some of the projects I’ve built while learning about **programming, distributed systems, and infrastructure**:

- [**TermiTacToe**](https://github.com/prasad-firame/TermiTacToe) – Terminal-based multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe with live board updates and win/draw detection.
- [**Mirro**](https://github.com/prasad-firame/mirro) – Lightweight, high-performance reverse proxy in Go supporting HTTP, TCP, and WebSocket traffic with load balancing and minimal configuration.
