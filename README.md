# Hi there 👋 , want to know more? [about me](https://axcec.github.io/ace/)

Currently, I am learning more about distributed systems and infra.
In my free time, I like to build. Here are a few things i'm planning to build in next few months:

- [Navi](https://github.com,): A Go CLI tool to manage and navigate directories quickly.
- [gossip-cache](https://github.com/axcec/gossip-cache): Distributed buffer-cache for Go services
- [cognitrace](https://github.com/axcec/cognitrace): AI agent memory leak scanner 
- [sql-ast-parser](https://github.com/axcec/sql-ast-parser): Java SQL AST parser 
- [lexer-go](https://github.com/axcec/lexer-go): Universal Go lexer (Docker/SQL/YAML → tokens → parsers)
- [go-vllm](https://github.com/axcec/go-vllm): Native Go bindings for vLLM 
-  Unfold :
    Say it. See it. Save it.
      - [unfold_frontend_web](https://github.com/neooxdev/unfold_frontend) - Next.js  
      - [unfold_mobile](https://github.com/neooxdev/unfold_mobile) - React Native  
      - [unfold_backend](https://github.com/neooxdev/unfold_backend) - Node.js / TypeScript  
    Turn everyday financial transactions into meaningful insights with simple questions, powered by NLP inference.  
    
    This is an MVP inspired by [Fold](https://fold.money), focused on making budgeting intuitive, conversational, and insightful.
